**Run simulation**

A new simulation is set up by creating a new directory and placing
- *Code.py*
- *serpent_iter.py*
- *SNF_LWR.txt* or any Serpent compatible fuel card containing TRU elements and uranium

into the empty directory. The fuel is then recycled according to the parameters specified in serpent_iter.py.

**Recycling**

**Postprocessing**

Two post-processing scripts are included as examples. They produce the plots and results found in the report using the functions developed.

For the scripts to work, they should be placed outside the directories that should be analysed (directories containing simulation results). 
*Code.py* must be included in the same directory as the postprocessing script.
